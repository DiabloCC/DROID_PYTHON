# droid-python

Forked and merged project of SL4A and Android-Python27

Both Python2.7 and Python3.2 have been embedded along with the latest
updated SL4a fork and converted into a Gradle build model for rapid development in Android Studio. 

Both apks have been tested on Kitkat 4.4.2 and Lollipop 5.0.1 as of 10/19/2015.

Please check the wiki for relevant resources for your build, more will be added when time permits.

Yes that is right, Python is back in business on Android!!!
